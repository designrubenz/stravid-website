Welcome to STRAVID. My name is David Strauß. I build value-adding software with other humans.

Software is only a means to an end. To reach a specific goal and build something useful you need more than technology. I can help with this because I know what is needed to build Resilient Software.

- Resilient Software is effective and serves a purpose.
- Resilient Software develops in a timely manner.
- Resilient Software is economic.
- Resilient Software adapts to change.
- Resilient Software operates correctly.
- Resilient Software is durable.

Many skills are needed to accomplish this. Top-quality technology is only one part of the big picture. Contact me and say “Hello” if you are interested in software projects that have an unambiguous positive outcome.

The best way to get support from me is through my company. We are based in [Salzburg and can help you in all software development related areas](https://www.edgycircle.com).

Here are a few things about me personally: My bookshelf is filled and there are still a lot of books on my wishlist. My dad showed me the beauty of [cycling](https://www.strauss.io/blog/2018-bikepacking-hof-bei-salzburg-to-chieming.html). When it comes to cooking my mum is my role model. I'm currently in the process of [digitizing my recipe collection](https://www.stravid.com/digitale-rezeptsammlung-kukku/). Apart from that I'm running a [popular darts scorer](https://app.dartboard.io), but don't have the time to play myself.
