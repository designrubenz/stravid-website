title: The digital home of David Strauß
description: About robust software and digital self-sufficiency.
---

 I'm David Strauß and I have a tilted front tooth. In my childhood I flooded my neighbourhood with a self-built dam. Since then I never stopped building things. Nowadays I prefer building digital things like software systems.

**Welcome to my digital home.** It has many different rooms that accommodate the various things that I do and build.
