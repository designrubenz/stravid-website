<h1>Merry Geekly Everybody!</h1>

<p>
Ismail Hanli, a friend and fellow student of mine, finally deployed the new version of his blog / portfolio! The whole thing is named <a href="http://ismailhanli.multimediatechnology.at">Geekly</a> since he has the ambitious goal of writing an interesting blog post for people like us every week. I'm looking forward to see if he can live up to the expectations and deliver fresh content every once in a while.
</p>
<p>
The other thing I'm really excited about is his current university project, <a href="https://github.com/ihanli/sbicktAndroid">s'bickt</a>. Ismail talking about s'bickt:
</p>
<p>
<em>"s'bickt is an augmented reality, community based app available for iOS and Android devices. It tags your messages with geodata and projects them onto the screen, when you activate the camera."</em>
</p>
<p>
Wish you the best of luck with that!
</p>
<p>
In my own interest: On the 27th of December it's time for the <a href="https://github.com/MathiasPaumgarten/marblerun">Marble Run</a> development kick-off! We will move into <a href="http://mathias-paumgarten.com">Mathias</a> place to get some stuff done, and we expect to gather lots of fun material we can show off besides the finished product. And then there is also <a href="https://github.com/MathiasPaumgarten/pic-each-minute">Pic Each Minute</a>, which will be released shortly after Marble Run.
</p>
<p>
The next month will be a hell of a wild ride, so put on your fancy pants, you will enjoy it!
