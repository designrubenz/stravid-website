Do you actually know when your friends were born? Or do you just do what Facebooks tells you to do?
</p>
<p>
A few days ago my friend <a href="http://www.mathias-paumgarten.com">Mathias</a> decided it would be funny to change his birthday on Facebook to the next day, the 28th of November. That's a shift of nearly six months compared to his real birthday! What started as a funny idea without any intentions grew into a quite interesting experiment with roughly 350 participants alias friends.
</p>
<p>
So what happened? 65 poor souls really thought the 28. of November is Mathias birthday.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>About 50 of them posted on the wall</li>
  <li>The rest used Facebook Messages, texted or made a phone call</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Although some wall posts clearly stated that the birthday date is not correct people kept posting their congratulations. And others even drank a beer on his birthday party 6 months ago but still weren't able to spot the trap.
</p>
<p>
So what do we learn? Depending on the definition of a friend Facebook should probably use the term "Contacts" instead of "Friends". And an old school, paper based, birthday calender like my father uses is still the best solution: No fake birthdays and it's more likely that you will call your friend instead of a simple wall post.
