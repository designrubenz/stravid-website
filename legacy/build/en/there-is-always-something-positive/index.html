<h1>There is always something positive</h1>

<p>
Or why I stopped hating my campus room.
</p>
<p>
My desk faces a 3 meter wide window front, offering me a pretty beautiful view on mother nature. The problem with this is, it’s pointing directly in a SSW direction, so once the sun is up in the sky I can see shit on my screen. And this makes me furious, how the hell should I work if I can only see myself in the <del datetime="2010-09-23T08:15:55+00:00">mirror</del> screen?
</p>
<p>
This lasted until today.
After a nice morning run by the river I discovered this <a href="http://www.deliveringhappinessbook.com/happy-wrap/">awesome video clip</a> from the <a href="http://www.deliveringhappinessbook.com/">Delivering Happiness Bus Tour</a> (Thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/glennmc">@glennmc</a> for the tweet) while eating breakfast. Then at midday I was chatting with the awesome Mike when dear sun reached the point of “Have fun with your CPU powered mirror”. Thankfully I was listening to the video I mentioned above, because suddenly a thought struck me:
</p>
<p>
I own a life quality boosting room.
</p>
<p>
So once the sun is up and working gets impossible I get outside and forget work. Don’t be angry, life is short. Smile instead and stay happy :-)
