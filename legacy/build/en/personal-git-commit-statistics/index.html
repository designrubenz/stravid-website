<h1>Personal Git Commit Statistics</h1>

<p>Update&#58; Thomas Buchöster and I built <a href='http://hulkort.herokuapp.com/'>Hulkort</a>, a website which let&#8217;s you track your Git commit statistics with the help of Git hooks!</p>

<p>I like data. I love having data about myself. So naturally I love tracking data about myself.</p>

<h2 id='what_and_why'>What and Why</h2>

<p>Programming is one field where I track nearly no data about myself. But I would love to, since I do it all the time. A friend, <a href='http://cwinkler.multimediatechnology.at/'>Christian Winkler</a>, and I once wrote a <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=961'>plugin</a> for our favorite editor <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/'>Sublime Text</a>, that would track how many seconds you spend working on a specific file. It worked, but the data was not really useful at all. Atleast I had proof that I think more than I press keys.</p>

<p>So how about using Git as medium to get some decent programming metrics? The number of commits one makes is in my opinion the most representative one. Lines of code added / changed / deleted is not really suitable since adding a framework like Ruby on Rails will falsify the data.</p>

<h2 id='possible_solutions'>Possible Solutions</h2>

<p>But how can I track how many commits I make?</p>

<h3 id='1_pen_and_paper'>#1 Pen And Paper</h3>

<p>Making notes myself everytime I commit. Easy and transparent, but it&#8217;s impossible to automate this process.</p>

<h3 id='2_github_api'>#2 GitHub API</h3>

<p>Since most of my projects are hosted at GitHub I could use their API and get the commit count for my account. Super easy, but also not possible at the moment according to their support.</p>

<h3 id='3_git_commands_on_local_repositories'>#3 Git Commands On Local Repositories</h3>

<p>With Gits commands I could filter out the commit count for my author name on each repository. A possible solution, although it feels like a hack and is not so easy to do.</p>

<h3 id='4_github_hooks'>#4 GitHub Hooks</h3>

<p>GitHub provides <a href='http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/'>hooks</a> for every repository. I could enter a callback url which gets pinged every time a push happens. To do this, you need admin access to the repository.</p>

<h3 id='5_personal_git_hook'>#5 Personal Git Hook</h3>

<p>I could write my own Git hook and add it to all my repositories. Each time I commit, the hook would ping a web server to notify it of the new commit. Being not online is a problem with this solution. In this case you could save it locally, but this makes everything even more complicated.</p>

<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure which path I will go down, at the moment the &#8220;Personal Git Hook&#8221; looks like the best option. But maybe there is someone with an even better idea! Anyone?</p>
