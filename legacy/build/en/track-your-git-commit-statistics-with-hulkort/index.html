<h1>Track Your Git Commit Statistics With Hulkort</h1>

<p><a href='http://hulkort.herokuapp.com/'>Hulkort</a> helps you tracking your Git commit statistics. It&#8217;s as simple as eating ice cream, try it yourself!</p>

<h2 id='history'>History</h2>

<p>Similar to many fellow programmers I like data. Since I spend a lot of time programming I looked for a way to track such data.</p>

<p>I thought Git could provide the best data. So I wrote a <a href='http://stravid.com/articles/personal-git-commit-statistics/'>post</a> about the different ways one could use to get statistics from Git.</p>

<p>After some comments on <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2965626'>Hacker News</a> and a bunch of emails I decided to go with a post-commit hook. After 10 minutes poking around with Git hooks I was tracking my Git commit statistics. <a href='http://www.postbin.org/'>Postbin</a> helped storing the data.</p>

<p>But what is data without graphs? Getting the data from Postbin and putting it into a spreadsheet is a pain.</p>

<p>So I built <a href='http://hulkort.herokuapp.com/'>Hulkort</a> with the help of Thomas Buchöster.</p>

<p>If you are into statistics like me, you should give it a try! Getting started is a matter of 2 minutes and I would love to hear your feedback!</p>
