title: Achtung die Kurve with HTML5 Canvas
---
<p>
Finally I can announce that <a href="http://stravid.com/projects/achtung-die-kurve/">Achtung die Kurve</a> is released!
</p>
<p>
Achtung die Kurve is a little project I did with my friend <a href="http://www.mathias-paumgarten.com">Mathias Paumgarten</a>. We wanted to port the old C++ / Flash game to the browser using only JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas element.
</p>
<p>
The game description and the "How to play" instructions can be found on the <a href="http://stravid.com/projects/achtung-die-kurve/">project page</a>!
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in the source code the <a href="https://github.com/stravid/achtung-die-kurve">GitHub repository</a> is the place to be, we appreciate any comments and suggestions.
