<h1>2012 In Numbers</h1>

<p>I never wrote a detailed account of what I have accomplished in a year but I think now it&#8217;s a good time to start. This will allow me to compare things at the end of 2013 and measure my progress.</p>

<p>In July I finished my education by graduating from Salzburg University of Applied Sciences as a Bachelor of Science in Engineering with honours. Looking back I dearly miss my peers and the great time we had, especially in the first years.</p>

<p>The graduation was also the only time I went on holidays. A quick five day trip to Lake Garda. Around this time I also moved from campus to the city in my own apartment sharing it with my girlfriend and a friend.</p>

<p>Driven by a random blog post about reading I started picking up books again. Altogether I read 21 books or 6140 pages. My own book, <a href='http://www.amazon.de/HTML5-Games-Most-Wanted-ebook/dp/B007PSRRFQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=books-intl-de&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351782563&amp;sr=1-1'>HTML5 Games Most Wanted</a>, was finally published.</p>

<p>I managed to write 8 blog posts for this site and one paid guest post for the IBM blog. Looking at the stats, this site had 4955 unique pageviews.</p>

<p>Regarding my health I only managed to exercise on 40 days. In detail it splits up like this:</p>

<p>1 day rock climbing<br />2 days biking<br />16 days strength training<br />21 days running</p>

<p>Apparently Fitbit doesn&#8217;t give me overall stats for a year, so this lifetime numbers have to do (next year I can calculate the correct numbers for 2013).</p>

<p>930113 steps<br />2273 floors<br />711 km<br />100613 active score</p>

<p>Business-wise I made plans to start a company with two friends. It took some time to find a name but in the end we settled on <a href='http://edgycircle.com/en/'>edgy circle</a>. I also finished my first professional project with Ruby on Rails. In total I earned € 1906,- which is pretty much nothing.</p>
